# Domain Modeling:
## Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
## When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
## Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
## Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
## Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
## Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
## Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

# HTML:
# CH:6
# Tables: 
## some time we need to store information in grid format so we use tables.
## \<table> element is use to create tables, \<th> for hidings, \<tr> element use for row and \<td> element use for column.
## colspan attributes use for stritch columns.
## rowspan attributes use for stritch rows.
## \<thead>, \<body>, \<tfoot> these elements put your html strucure inside table.

# JavaScript:
# CH3:
## global variable use memory more than local variable.
# Object: group together a set of variables and functions to create a modelof a something you would recognize from the real world.
## If you want to access inside variable or function of an object write name of object then dote then name of variable.
## creat an object using constructor notation that you declear an empty object then you put properties and methods.
## to update an object use its name and dote or square bracec.
## you can create more than one objects using functions for the same objects.
## this keyword using inside an object to arrive to a local variable.
## array is an special type of objects, and you can create more than one array and object together to make a complex type of data.
## browser come with built in objects, document window object contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab, Document Object Model uses objects to create a representation of the current page and global JavaScript objects represent things that the JavaScript language needs to create a model.
##  JavaScript has six types of data: boolean, numbers, string, objects and null.
# Summary:
## Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
## Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.
## An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
## In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
## Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
## JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
## Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
