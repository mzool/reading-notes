# Problem domain:
## Its consedered as one of the hardest parts in programming, because before starting coding, the problem and the reasons of that should determine.
## How to fix that problem domain is hard?
## its not hard if you divided it into parts, and then work step by step.

# Objects: group together a set of variable and functions.
## In objects variable become properties and functions become methods.
## Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean.
## Arrays have a name and a group of values. 
## Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.
## Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs.
## Literal notation is the easiest way to creat an object.
## If we want to access an object we write the name of the object then write dote then write ';' and finally the name of the propety or method.
# CH5:
# The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
## Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML is represented by its own DOM node.
## element node describe the structure of an HTML page. 
## Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
## Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
## Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 
## you can access the element by three ways, individual, multiple elements and transverse between elements.
## The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably but when people say the DOM is working with an element, it is actually working with a node that represents that element. 
## When work with element more than others then use a variable to save changes.
## When storing elements in variabls then that elements store in DOM tree by them location.
## getElementByld( 1 id 1) Selects an individual element given the value of its i d attribute . 
## querySel ector( 1css selector') Uses CSS selector syntax that would select one or more elements .
## getEl ementsByClassName( 1class 1 ) Selects one or more elements given the value of their cl ass attribute.  
## getEl ementsByTagName( 1tagName 1) Selects all elements on the page with the specified tag name. 
## querySelectorAll ( 1css select) Uses CSS selector syntax to select one or more elements and returns all of those that match.
