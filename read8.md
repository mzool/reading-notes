# CH15: layout
## CSS treats each HTML element box. This box will either be a block-level or an inline.
## Block-level boxes start on a new line.
## parent element is the block element that hold another bolck element.
## positions of element could be: normal, relative, absolute, fixed and floating.
## In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.
## Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. 
## absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the other element position.
## Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
## float element let you to take the element to the left or right of the containing box, and could uses to stuff element beside each other.
## clear element says that no element in the specified side can touch other element.
## you have to take care about screen size (960-1000) and screen resolution so the larger number of users can benifit.
## fixed width layout adv+: accurate pixels, more control, and constant image size.
## disadv-: maybe big gabs, the user screen higher resolution make the page small, and more vertical places.
## Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
## adv+: page will fit the user device, page fit the entire browser window, and tolerant design.
## disadv-: very long line with larger window, wrong width controling make the page different, and if a fixed width item in box that is too small to hold it the user has made the window smaller then the item can overflow the text.
## CSS framework: 
## ad+: no repeatedly writing codes and teste arround many browsers versions.
## disadv-: more codes that you need and use a class in html page.
