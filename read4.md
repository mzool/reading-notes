# HTML:
# Chapter 4: Links
## Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another.
## Links creat with using "a" tags that you put the url inside the opening tag, and between opening and closing tag you can writ any thing for explaining.
## "herf" value depend on what the page you want the user to go to.
## you can link to another page in your website by using relative path.
## In large websites its good to put every page in different directory, to organize them, and specify the relation ship between you pages to make the user to navigate easly, usually the main page called home page.
## mailto: to creat a url with email address..
## Use "target" with 'a' tag to open the link in new tab, should followed by "_blank".

# CH15: layout
## CSS treats each HTML element box. This box will either be a block-level or an inline.
## Block-level boxes start on a new line.
## parent element is the block element that hold another bolck element.
## positions of element could be: normal, relative, absolute, fixed and floating.
## In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.
## Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. 
## absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the other element position.
## Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
## float element let you to take the element to the left or right of the containing box, and could uses to stuff element beside each other.
## clear element says that no element in the specified side can touch other element.
## you have to take care about screen size (960-1000) and screen resolution so the larger number of users can benifit.
## fixed width layout adv+: accurate pixels, more control, and constant image size.
## disadv-: maybe big gabs, the user screen higher resolution make the page small, and more vertical places.
## Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
## adv+: page will fit the user device, page fit the entire browser window, and tolerant design.
## disadv-: very long line with larger window, wrong width controling make the page different, and if a fixed width item in box that is too small to hold it the user has made the window smaller then the item can overflow the text.
## CSS framework: 
## ad+: no repeatedly writing codes and teste arround many browsers versions.
## disadv-: more codes that you need and use a class in html page.

# JaveScript:
# CH3:
## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
## when you ask to perform thats calling function.
## information given to a fuction called parameters.
## answer or response called return value.
## To creat a function write function then write its name after that  parameters braces after that curly brace that hold the statements.
## declaring and calling function need information.
## variable scope: that if you creat a variable inside a function it will be defined and use just inside that function.
## local scope using inside the function, and global scope using any where inside the code.
## Global variable need more memory.
## we can say anything inside the computer call objects, what descripe that objects call property, and if there a fuction related to that objecy it call methode.

# Pair Programming:
## practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
## how pair programming work?
## there are two rules, first one is the "driver" programmer who coding the program, typing, choosing, and the only one who use keyboard, and the second one is the navigator someone who give feedback to the programmer if we could say.
## why to pair programming?
## developer listen to other, writing, speaking about the code and the other's code.

+ # Advantages:
+ ## sharing experience.
+ ## more efficiency.
+ ## learning from each other.
+ ##  more social skills.
+ ## prepare for interview.
