# JavaScript:
# CH10:
# stack: javaScript takes order line by line, and when need information from another variable below it stack.
# Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity:
## prapare: praparing a scope and creating the variable.
## excute: assigning process and run the code.
# If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handl ing code. 
# Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them. 
## DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS If you come across an error while writing a script, you will need to debug the code, track down the source of the error, and fix it. 
## HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch, throw, and f i na 1 ly statements. 
# how to start debugging:

+ ##  read the error massage.
+ ## When you have set breakpoints, you can see if the variables around them have the values you would expect them to.
+ ## Break down I break out parts of the cod


# The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script, where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.
# If you set multiple breakpoints, you can step through them one-by-one to see where values change and a problem might occur.
