# Chapter 13: Boxes

+ #  CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
+ ## we can choose the box width and height.
+ ## By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents.
+ ## When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window.
+ ## min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow.
+ ## max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
+ ## use min height and max height to limit the height.
+ ## overflow tell the browser what to do when the contents larger than the box it self, scroll or hide.
+ ## Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
+ ## border: separates the edge of one box from another
+ ## margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border
+ ## padding: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. 
+ ## The border-width property is used to control the width of a border, border style for style it.
+ ## The padding property allows to specify how much space between the content of an element and its border. 
+ ## The margin property controls the gap between boxes.
+ ## The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element.
+ ## The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users.
+ ## The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box.
+ ## box-shadow: add a drop shadow around a box.

## loops: check a condition, if it give true the code run and check the value a gain tell it give false then stop.
## for loop use counter to run a code specified number of time.
## break: termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside of the loop.
## continue: continue with the current iteration, and then check the condition again.
