# Visual Editors and Code views:
## There are many features that are the same in many editors:
+ ## Headings are created by highlighting text then using a drop-down box to select a heading.
+ ## Bold and italic text are created by highlighting some text and pressing a b or i.
+ ## New paragraphs are created using the enter key.
+ ## Line breaks are created by pressing shift and return key at the same time.
+ ## Horizontal rules are created using a button with a straight line on it.

# To understand how CSS work, you have to know the html strucure, inline elements and block elements, then you can choose the appearance for each one of them.
# CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. 
# CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed, there are two values you need to determine;     **{property: value;}**, first you write the property you want to modify after that the value of it.
